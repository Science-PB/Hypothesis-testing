#A. Load the MASS Library in R...Package 'MASS' which provides a description of the datasets available in the MASS Package
library(MASS)
#Additional Library functions:
library(FSAdata) #For headtail function

#B.  One-sample t-test: Use the “chem” dataset to answer the question,
#“is the flour production company producing whole meal flour with greater
#than 1 part per million copper in it?” 
#H0: mu <= 1
#Ha: mu > 1
chem
t.test(chem,mu=1,alternative = "greater",conf.level=0.95)

#C. Two-sample t-test: Use the “cats” dataset to answer the question,
#“do male and female cat samples have the same body weight?” 
#Hint: one way to get separate vectors for male and female cat body weight
#is to use the subset function as follows: “male <-subset(cats, subset=(cats$Sex=M))” 
#H0: mu_1 = mu_2
#Ha: mu_1 != mu_2
headtail(cats)
catsM <- cats[cats$Sex=='M',]
catsF <- cats[cats$Sex=='F',]
t.test(catsM$Bwt,catsF$Bwt,alternative="two.sided")

#D. Paired t-test: Use the “shoes” dataset to answer the question,
#“did material A wear better than material B?” 
#H0: mu_1 >= mu_2
#Ha: mu_1 < mu_2
shoes
t.test(shoes$A,shoes$B,paired=TRUE,alternative="less")

#E. Test of equal or given proportions: Use the “bacteria” data set
#to answer the question, “did the drug treatment have a significant
#effect of the presence of the bacteria compared with the placebo?” 
#H0: mu_1 <= mu_2
#Ha: mu_1 > mu_2
headtail(bacteria)
btable<-table(bacteria$y,bacteria$trt)
btable
prop.test(x = c(31,12), n = c(124,96), alternative = "greater")


#F. F-test: Use the “cats” data set to test for the variance
#of the body weight in male and female cats. 
#H0: s_1^2 = s_2^2
#Ha: s_1^2 != s_2^2
headtail(cats)
var.test(catsM$Bwt, catsF$Bwt, alternative="two.sided")
